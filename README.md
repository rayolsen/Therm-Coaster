# Temperature-Coaster

The idea is simple, create a drink coaster which changes color based on temperature of the cup/drink placed on it.  

I plan on using ATTiny85 do the work, since it should run on 3v 
CR2023 is 3v and should have enough mA to power it and some SK6812 / 5050 RGB LEDS
And a thermresistor will sense the temp, obviously.

The end game is to dip the board in resin to waterproof and protect the board making into an actual coaster
