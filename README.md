# Temperature-Coaster

The idea is simple, create a drink coaster which changes color based on temperature of the cup/drink placed on it.  

I plan on using ATTiny85 do the work, since it should run on 3v 
CR2023 is 3v and should have enough mA to power it and some SK6812 / 5050 RGB LEDS
And a thermresistor will sense the temp, obviously.

The end game is to dip the board in resin to waterproof and protect the board making into an actual coaster
The bottom side of the board will have the battery holder and pads to program the Attiny85.  I plan on leaving a recess in the epoxy to allow battery access.  I may make a recess for the pads for debugging,  but i plan to work out the code and kinks before putting it in resin

Keeping in with the rules of the challenge, i've added the board to [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/DYg7IxAX)
